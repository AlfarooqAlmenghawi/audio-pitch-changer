# Audio Pitch Changer

An audio pitch changer application designed to change the pitch and tempo of an audio file SIMULTANEOUSLY, as websites that allow changing pitch and tempo of an audio at the same time are scarce on the internet. Audio pitch is controlled by providing a decimal value acting as the percentage (where 1 = 100%, 0.8 = 80%, etc.)
